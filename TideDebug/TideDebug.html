		<p>you can see the <b>TIDEDebug</b> menu below the search field (currently Run - Pause - Stop - Step Into -
		Step Over - Step Out - Toggle Breakpoint are working, "Run To Cursor" and "Add / Remove watch" arent implemented yet).
		You can pause the process at any time and add/remove breakpoints... although you cant add watches yet,
		you can check the value of simple variables with the tooltips...
		<b>TIDEBrowse</b> and <b>TIDEDebug</b> are combined into one "TIDE" menu entry ...
		there is also a specific "TIDE project" - you have to create a new TIDE project (not a usual ProjectViewer project) 
		if you want to use the debugger - that's because you have to specifiy your debug parameters which are saved to a
		TIDE properties file.
		<br>
		TIDE will then also ask you to let it patch your "main.cs" file because it needs to make some changes to enable debugging
		(add command line parameters and a few functions) to that file (it will make a backup of the file first, of course :-)
		it is called "<b>main_prePatch.cs</b>").
		<br>
		<b>NOTE:</b> <i>If your main.cs file is heavily modified TIDE may encounter problems patching it</i>...
		in that case you´d have to patch a "standard" main.cs (I´ve tested with the Torque HEAD version) and diff your own version manually
		(I will also put a correctly patched main.cs into the download - you can look for the comments in there:
		<br>// TorqueDebugPatcher begin
		<br>... 
		<br>// TorqueDebugPatcher end
		<br>).
		<br><i>Tribes</i> scripters will have to edit the file manually, too! (haven't tested it, but
		the patching will definately not work there).</p>
		
		
		<p><b>Here is a quick how-to by Paul Dana:</b></p>
		
		<p>Choose "<b>New Project...</b>" under the TIDE plugin menu to create a new project for
		testing. You must specify the game executable. TIDE is capable of launching
		your game and automatically connecting to the Torque built-in telnet debugger.
		However...to pull this off TIDE must patch your game script to allow for
		command line options to automatically enable debug mode, set debug port and
		password, etc. You will be prompted before your game scripts will be patched.</p>
		
		<p>In this version you can set breakpoints at any time as long as the project
		contains that file. In the previous version of TIDE you could only set
		breakpoints after you paused execution. Now you can set breakpoints first
		and hit the "run" button and the breakpoints will be set automatically. Any
		breakpoints you set will cause the program to pause exeuction when they
		are reached.</p>
		
		<p>You don't need to set breakpoints to pause execution. You can just hit
		the Pause Icon on the <b>TideDebug</b> toolbar. It's the second icon from the
		left and looks like two verticle bars.<br>
		<b>NOTE:</b> the game may not actually
		pause execution at this time! If the game is running but only a startup
		dialog box is showing you may have to 'nudge' the game by hitting the
		tilde key (~) to open the console.</p>
		
		<p>When the game is paused the file that is currently executing will come to the
		front and all the possible places to put a breakpoint are indicated with little
		green dots in the 'gutter' running down the left of the text area. To place a
		breakpoint put your cursor on the desired line and hit the "Set Breakpoint"
		icon on the <b>TideDebug</b> toolbar. It looks like a stopsign. A little red stop
		sign icon will appear in the gutter next to that line instead of a green dot.</p>
		
		<p><i>Do not edit any files either while in pause mode or while the game is
		running.</i> This is not handled in this version.</p>
