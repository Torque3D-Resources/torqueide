In this version you can set breakpoints at any time as long as the project
contains that file. In the previous version of Tide you could only set
breakpoints after you paused execution. Now you can set breakpoints first
and hit the "run" button and the breakpoints will be set automatically. Any
breakpoints you set will cause the program to pause exeuction when they
are reached.

You dont need to set breakpoints to pause execution. You can just hit
the Pause Icon on the TideDebug toolbar. It's the second icon from the
left and looks like two verticle bars. NOTE: the game may not actually
pause execution at this time! If the game is running but only a startup
dialog box is showing you may have to 'nudge' the game by hitting the
tilde key (~) to open the console.

When the game is paused the file that is currently executing will come to the
front and all the possible places to put a breakpoint are indicated with little
blue dots in the 'gutter' running down the left of the text area. To place a
breakpoint put your cursor on the desired line and hit the Set Breakpoint
icon on the TideDebug toolbar. It looks like a stopsign. A little red stop
sign icon will appear in the gutter next to that line instead of a blue dot.

Do not edit any files either while in pause mode or while the game is
running. This is not handled in this version.
