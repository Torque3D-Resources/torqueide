TIDE Info Docs

Torque Integrated Development Environment (TIDE) is a free, cross-platform IDE
for Torque Game Engine scripting. It is implemented in Java as a plug-in for
the jEdit text editor. You should be
familiar with TGE scripting. You do not have to own a license to the TGE
C++ source code, but you must have a game installation (such as the standard
FPS demo game) that contains a game executable. If you are running windows
this executable might be c:/torque/example/torqueDemo_DEBUG.exe.

Choose New Project... under the Tide plugin menu to create a new project for
testing. You must specify the game executable. Tide is capable of launching
your game and automatically connecting to the Torque built-in telnet debugger.
However...to pull this off Tide must temporarily patch your game script to allow for
command line options to automatically enable debug mode, set debug port and
password, etc. when the game is started.
