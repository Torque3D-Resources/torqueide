# Torque Integrated Development Environment (TIDE)

Torque Integrated Development Environment (TIDE) is a free, cross-platform IDE for Torque Game Engine scripting by Paul Dana and Stefan Moises.
It is implemented in Java as a "plugin suite" for the jEdit text editor and contains plugins for syntax highlighting, code completion, function browsing, script debugging, etc.

It can be used for Torque script files (TGE, TGEA, TBG, T2D, T3D etc.) as well as Tribes/Tribes2 game scripts...
 
TIDE supports JEdit 4.3. It requires Java (JDK) >= 1.4 and runs on MacOS X, OS/2, Unix/Linux, VMS and Windows.

Download recent Windows version (installer including JEdit 4.3.1, JRE 6u18, all plugins and files)!
